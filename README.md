# DS340W--Project
This repository includes the dataset files and the code files we plan to change to implement other strategies to increase accuracy ultimately improving hate speech detection. It includes the dataset used for HATECHECK and dataset used for Counter-speech (target and parent) and it inlcudes HateXplain dataset, commanly used in hate speech detection. The code for 29 funtionality testing is included along with BERT model code. We plan to implement LLM to these datasets and compare with baseline models like BERT and RoBerta.
