# DS340W--Project
This repository includes the dataset files and the code files we implemented to creating a stacked model for hate speech detection. We used the dataset from parent paper 1 (davidson2017) and the BERT model from paper 1. We created a revised RoBerta model using the same dataset and finally stacked the 2 models to created a new large language model resulting in a higher accuracy and F1-score; suggesting a new and improved hate speech detection model.
